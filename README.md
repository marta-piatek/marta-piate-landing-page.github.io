# Landing Page Project

This is my project number 2 of the Front-End Developer Nanodegree, which primarily focuses on making the website dynamic using Javascript.

# Features

Here are the features that have been developed for this project.

## Dynamic Navigation Bar

When the website loads, the navigation bar items are built as unordered list into the HTML using Javascript. Javascript loops through all the sections of the page and create `a` and `li` tags under the navigation's `ul` tag.

## Scrolling

When the user clicks on an navigation bar item, the page scrolls to the top of the corresponding section on the page.

## Collapsible Sections

When the user clicks on a section's title (`h2`), the section expands to show its content. When an expanded section is clicked on, it collapses and only shows the title.

## Back-To-Top Button

When the user scrolls below the page fold, a back-to-top button appears on the bottom-right corner. When clicked, the page scrolls all the way to the top.

## Highlighting

These are the highlighting features included:

### Sections

When the user hovers over a section, the section's background changes to gradient red. When the mouse is out of the section (`h2`), it goes back to its original background color.

### Navigation Bar Items

When the user hovers over a section, the corresponding navigation bar item is also highlighted (background changes to gradient red).
